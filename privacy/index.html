<p><em>Updated 16 September 2024</em></p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy” or “Privacy Policy”) describes how Stream Financial Technology Corporation, a Delaware limited liability company (together with its affiliated companies and subsidiaries worldwide, collectively, “STREAMOS”, “our”, “we” and “us”) collects and handles personal data (i.e. information about a natural person, or to the extent applicable privacy law covers a business entity, the covered business entity) submitted to or processed through the <a href="https://www.streamos.io">https://www.streamos.io</a>, the STREAMOS application (the “STREAMOS Website”, “Website”) or “STREAMOS Platform”), and/or any other services, applications and features offered or enabled by or through us with respect thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (all services offered through the STREAMOS Website or the STREAMOS Platform, collectively, “Services”).  Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Policy have those meanings given to them in our Terms. We value your trust and take our privacy obligations seriously.  We have tried to describe our policies in a clear and concise manner below.  We like feedback so please let us know if you have any questions or would like further clarity.</p>
<p>This Policy applies whether you are a customer that subscribes to and uses the Services, a prospective customer, an employee, customer or other end user of our customer that utilizes our solutions, a user of our Services, or whether you are simply visiting our Website. However, this Policy does not apply to any websites of third parties to which we provide links. This Privacy Policy does not describe our collection and use of personal data in the context of employment, applications for employment, and related activities. If you want to request more information concerning personal data we collect in the human resources context, please reach out to STREAMOS HR at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#72;&#82;&#64;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#109;&#111;&#115;&#46;&#105;&#111;">&#72;&#82;&#64;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#109;&#111;&#115;&#46;&#105;&#111;</a></p>
<p>When you interact with the Website or the Services, you consent to such collection, processing, sharing and retaining of information (including personal information/personal data and geolocation data) as described in this Privacy Policy and all additional terms and conditions governing your use of the Website or the Services. You are also responsible for ensuring that the entity or people on behalf of which you are acting (such as your employer or a customer) are aware of the content of this Privacy Policy and that you have confirmed that they agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and all additional terms and conditions, do not continue to interact with or use the Website or the Services.</p>
<h4 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h4>
<p>StreamOS is a software company with its main offices in Los Angeles, CA.  We provide platforms that streamline financial and accounting workflows which include subscription, revenue and receivables management platforms to help businesses offer flexible pricing and bundle packaging, marketplace solutions that enable providers for financial solutions for multi sided marketplaces. Most of our customers are business entities or other organizations.</p>
<p>We offer our services to Customers worldwide.</p>
<p>We collect and process personal data for our own use in managing our business and offering our services.  Most of this Privacy Policy describes our policies for data that we collect and use for our own business purposes.</p>
<p>We also process personal data that our customers have collected (either independently of our Services or using our Services) and asked us to process for them as part of our Services. We use this Customer-controlled data only as permitted by our customers in our agreements with them and not for our own general business purposes. We have included information below to describe our commitments to you if we have access to your data in our role as a service provider for a customer, but you should review the privacy policy of our C=customer that controls your personal data to understand its privacy practices.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-contact-us">How to Contact Us</h4>
<p>Please contact us if you have any questions about the information in this Privacy Policy or our handling of your personal data, or would like to access, correct, delete, restrict our use, or take other action with regard to your personal data. We ask, however, that if we are in possession of your data solely as a service provider for our customer, you first contact our customer with your request.</p>
<p>You may contact us by calling us at 1-801-810-8644, by submitting the request via our website, by sending an email to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#109;&#111;&#115;&#46;&#105;&#111;">&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#109;&#111;&#115;&#46;&#105;&#111;</a> or by mailing us at: Stream Financial Technology Corporation, 145 S Fairfax Ave #200, Los Angeles, CA 90036.</p>
<h4 id="changes-to-this-policy">Changes to this Policy</h4>
<p>We will manage your personal data in accordance with the Privacy Policy version that was published on the date that we collected the data about you. We may amend or otherwise modify all or a portion of this Privacy Policy from time to time. The revised Privacy Policy will be available on this website, and if you are a customer of our Services, we may also provide your administrative users (as identified in your account) with notice of such changes by e-mail. You are responsible for periodically reviewing the Privacy Policy as posted on the Website. Amendments and modifications to the Privacy Policy will be deemed effective once posted online. Your continued use of the Services following any modification constitutes your acceptance of the modified terms, except to the extent that (i) other notice or consent is required by applicable law, rules, or regulations; or (ii) if you are a then-current customer, such change has a material adverse impact on you and you do not agree to the change, in which case you may terminate this Agreement by giving at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to STREAMOS (such termination notice to be sent at the latest 60 days after such change was posted to the Website). You are not entitled to object to, and will not have the rights set out in this clause, for any change that StreamOS implements in order to comply with applicable law, rules, or regulations. For such imposed changes, shorter notice periods may be applied by STREAMOS as needed to comply with the relevant requirement. Please contact us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#109;&#111;&#115;&#46;&#105;&#111;">&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#109;&#111;&#115;&#46;&#105;&#111;</a> if you would like to see a prior version of our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We automatically collect certain types of usage information when users view the Website. We may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Website (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Website) and allows us to track your usage of the Website over time.

<p>We use online advertising services that enable a practice referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” These services aggregate data about an individual’s behavior on many different sites and online services, and use that data to sell targeted advertising services. For example, we permit Google’s advertising services to collect data about your behavior on StreamOS, or its subsidiaries, Websites, as do many other website operators who use Google’s ad services. Google combines the data about an individual that it collects from different sources, and uses this aggregate data to sell advertising services that target the display of ads to web users who meet certain behavioral criteria. Google does not disclose this aggregate data to StreamOS, or its subsidiaries,, but we are able to infer that users who interact with our ad meet the advertising criteria we provided. Google collects this data using cookies, web server logs (its own and its advertising customers), clear gifs and other online data collection techniques.
