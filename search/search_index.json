Every reference to a UUID in a POST is an id of an object returned from another POST statement. streamOS maintains a factory that it references for all of these objects and links them together on run time. The Parent Contract is your ultimate tie in to the customer, so until the Parent Contract is created - contracts are orphans. Plans and Contracts can be reused - so once created you can use them over and over in other create objects for free, by just referencing the id. Overall Setup Flow The overall flow of creation follows this pattern: Create Customers: Create all the customers in streamOS appropriately and store the streamOS customer_ids Create Products: Create all the customers in streamOS appropriately and store the streamOS customer_ids Create Contracts: Create the appropriate contract structure that represent your contracts, verify using the UI if required Operational Flow Structure Usage: Ensure your usage flow is of the format specified in the /contracts/org_id/usage endpoint Get Charges: Every update of usage or a contract upload / update triggers a run of the contracts - use the charges endpoint to get the results. Force a contract run: if you want to force a contract run trigger this Modifications & Updates Modifying Contracts: Modifying contracts in streamOS is tantamount to creating a new contract. You would provide the same information as you did during contract creation to the same endpoint, except for the information that you are changing. Ensure you use the same id as the object you are replacing so that the system knows to replace existing references to it. Modifying Plans: Plans are modified in a similar fashion - post the modified information to the same endpoint with the same id to replace a plan definition. However, now that a plan has been changed - call the refresh endpoint to ensure that all contracts that reference this plan update their local copies of the plan.

All Feedback shall be owned by STREAMOS and You shall and hereby do, assign all of Your right, title, and interest in and to such Feedback to STREAMOS. 4. WARRANTIES. STREAMOS represents and warrants to its Direct Subscribers only that: a. it has the right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement, grant the rights and licenses granted herein, and fully perform its obligations hereunder; b. the Services will perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation; for purposes of these Terms, \u201cDocumentation\u201d means the operator and user information, training materials, guides, listings, specifications, and other materials, including online information and materials, relating to the use of the Services made available to You as part of the Services; c. the Services (exclusive of any Subscriber Data) do not infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party anywhere in the world and no third party, other than STREAMOS\u2019s licensors, has any proprietary interest in or to the Services (exclusive of any Subscriber Data); d. the Services do not intentionally contain, and STREAMOS will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent introduction of, malicious or disabling code that is intended to damage, destroy or destructively alter software, hardware, systems, or data; and If the warranty set forth in subsection (b) is breached, then: (i) You must promptly notify STREAMOS of the breach and provide any associated details reasonably requested by STREAMOS in its attempt to remedy the defect. STREAMOS will diligently and in good faith attempt to correct the reported defect within a commercially reasonable period of time. If STREAMOS is unable to cure that defect, then You may elect to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the unearned portion of any fees paid to STREAMOS for the remainder of the then-current term. THE REMEDIES OF REPERFORMANCE, TERMINATION AND REFUND ARE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, AND STREAMOS\u2019s ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF THE WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 4(b). Each Subscriber represents and warrants to STREAMOS that: a. it has the right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement, grant the rights and licenses granted herein, provide the Subscriber Data associated with such Subscriber and fully perform its obligations hereunder; b. the Subscriber Data associated with such Subscriber does not infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party anywhere in the world and no third party, other than Subscriber\u2019s licensors, has any proprietary interest in or to such Subscriber Data; c. Subscriber will not intentionally transmit or introduce, and Subscriber will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent introduction of, malicious or disabling code that is intended to damage, destroy or destructively alter software, hardware, systems, or data; and d. the performance of its obligations and use of the Services by Subscriber or its End Users will not violate any applicable laws, including, without limitation, any laws relating to the collection, maintenance, transmission or use of personal information or data. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, STREAMOS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. AS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF ALL SUBSCRIBER DATA USED BY YOU OR YOUR END USERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND ALL DATA, INFORMATION, REPORTS AND OUTPUT OF THE SERVICES. A SUBSCRIBER MAY NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF TO ITS CLIENTS OR END USERS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ITS RESELLER SUBSCRIBERS, IF APPLICABLE), OR ANY THIRD PARTY ON BEHALF OF STREAMOS. STREAMOS\u2019S PROVISION OF SERVICES TO THE RESELLER SUBSCRIBERS AND ALL END USERS IS ON AN \u201cAS-IS\u201d BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. 5. SERVICE CHANGES; SUPPORT; PERFORMANCE STREAMOS makes regular changes and improvements to the Services from time to time. Any intellectual property created in the course of implementing and providing the Services, whether by STREAMOS alone or jointly with You, will be and remain the exclusive property of STREAMOS, and You assign any of your rights, interest or title in or to the same to STREAMOS. In no event will any service changes materially reduce the functionality provided by the Services as of the date of the applicable Order. STREAMOS will communicate with Direct Subscribers about planned changes as may be necessary to ensure Your efficient use of the Services. STREAMOS will provide standard support to its Direct Subscribers and their authorized End Users at no additional charge; if You are a Reseller Subscriber or an End User of the same, then you must contact your Direct Subscriber to request support. STREAMOS is not responsible for (i) correcting errors resulting from misuse, negligence, revision, modification, or improper use of the Services; (ii) errors resulting from any software, hardware or equipment other than those used by STREAMOS or its providers to provide the Services; or (iii) any errors resulting from an End User\u2019s failure to comply with any applicable system or browser specifications set forth in the Documentation. For Subscribers, STREAMOS will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services will be available 99.9% of the time each month other than during scheduled or emergency maintenance. You understand that normal maintenance and backup procedures will cause temporary downtime during which the Services cannot be used. STREAMOS may also suspend or interrupt the Services as necessary to address significant issues or perform emergency maintenance. Without limitation, STREAMOS may suspend or interrupt the Services (or part of the Services) without notice: (i) if STREAMOS believes that any use of the Services represents a direct or indirect threat to the function or integrity of the Services, STREAMOS\u2019s or its service providers\u2019 system or networks, or any third party\u2019s use of the Services; (ii) if reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access to any Subscriber Data or other data or information stored on the Services; or (iii) to the extent necessary to comply with legal requirements. STREAMOS will use commercially reasonable efforts to restrict the scope and length of such suspension to that reasonably necessary to address the issues giving rise to the suspension. Your access to the Services is through the Internet, and you understand that your ability to use the Services is dependent on the global telecommunications infrastructure involving the reliability and performance. The Services may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications. STREAMOS is not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or other damage resulting from such problems. 6. THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS The Services may interoperate with various third-party platforms (\u201cThird-Party Platforms\u201d). You acknowledge that such integration features may be unavailable or may not work properly if the Third-Party Platform (or its API) is unavailable or if the applicable service provider (each, a \u201cThird Party Provider\u201d) modifies its API or services in a way that impacts the Services\u2019 integration feature. Continued interoperation of the Services with any Third-Party Platform is dependent upon the availability of each such platform, and STREAMOS may cease to provide such functionality (without any liability to you) if access to any Third-Party Platform is not available to STREAMOS on commercially reasonable terms. You further acknowledge and agree that (a) access and use of a Third Party Platform may be subject to Your subscription to or purchase of a separate license from (or agreement or acceptance of separate terms of use or similar terms with) the Third Party Provider; (b) You will review and comply with all such terms and conditions, and will not use the Third Party Platform in any manner that would infringe or violate the rights of STREAMOS or any other party or in furtherance of criminal, fraudulent or other unlawful activity; (c) the Third Party Provider, and not STREAMOS, is responsible for its own actions and inactions; (d) STREAMOS\u2019s provision of integrated access with such Third Party Platform via the Services may be revoked by the Third Party Provider or STREAMOS at any time and without notice or any liability to You; (e) if You subscribe to or otherwise use the Third Party Platform, STREAMOS may transmit to the applicable Third Party Provider that portion of your Subscriber Data residing in the Services as you direct (or as directed by the Subscriber through whom you have been granted access to the Services) or as otherwise is reasonably necessary for the Third Party Provider to perform and provide the Third Party Platform. Without limiting the generality of the terms of Section 4 of these Terms, each Subscriber represents and warrants that such Subscriber has either provided the owner of any such Subscriber Data notice or received permission from the owner of such Subscriber Data, as required by applicable law, for STREAMOS to: (i) use or disclose the Subscriber Data in accordance with STREAMOS\u2019s Privacy Policy, (ii) provide the data to Third Party Platform in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) otherwise use and disclose the Subscriber Data in accordance with this Agreement. If You are a Reseller Subscriber, You acknowledge that your access to the Services may be enabled via integration with your Direct Subscriber\u2019s own software platform, which will be considered a \u201cThird Party Provider\u201d (and such Direct Subscriber, a \u201cThird Party Provider\u201d) for purposes of this Section 6. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT STREAMOS\u2019S ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY PLATFORM ARE OFFERED BY STREAMOS SOLELY AS A CONVENIENCE TO ITS SUBSCRIBERS AND THEIR END USERS, AND STREAMOS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR COSTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF DATA OR PROPERTY ARISING FROM ANY CLAIMS WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT TORT), OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY PLATFORM, THE INTEGRATION OF SUCH THIRD PARTY PLATFORM WITH THE STREAMOS SERVICES, EVEN IF STREAMOS, ITS AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR COSTS. 7. SUBSCRIBER DATA A. Data Ownership and License STREAMOS does not own any data, information, or material that is submitted to the Service by You (\u201cSubscriber Data\u201d). You retain all right, title, and interest (including, where appropriate, copyright and other proprietary or intellectual property rights) in Subscriber Data, and STREAMOS explicitly disclaims any ownership of, or right, title, and interest in such Subscriber Data. If You provide any Subscriber Data to STREAMOS, You: (i) grant MAXIO the right to use, copy, modify, manipulate and create derivative works of the Subscriber Data as necessary in order for STREAMOS to provide and perform the Services; (ii) agrees to secure rights in the Subscriber Data necessary for STREAMOS to provide the Services without violating the rights of any third party, or otherwise obligating STREAMOS to any third party (except as otherwise set out in these Terms). As between STREAMOS and its Subscribers, Subscribers have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership of, or right to use, Subscriber Data. STREAMOS will only use Subscriber Data solely for purposes of providing the Services, providing support for the Services, and confirming Your compliance with these Terms. STREAMOS may transmit or disclose Subscriber Data to third parties in accordance with Your or Your Subscriber\u2019s directions (whether via the Services or otherwise). Subscribers are responsible for exporting Subscriber Data from the Services prior to termination of this Agreement. In the event (i) STREAMOS is required to respond to any search warrant, court order, subpoena other valid legal order relating to a Subscriber or the Subscriber Data, or (ii) a Subscriber requests material assistance from STREAMOS in connection with Subscriber\u2019s efforts to conduct any investigation, to cooperate with or respond to any investigation being conducted by a third party, or to pursue or respond to any matter or respond to any legal or administrative proceeding or similar matter, such Subscriber will reimburse STREAMOS for any cost that it incurs in so responding or assisting. You acknowledge that STREAMOS may collect and analyze Subscriber Data and other information about Your usage of the Services to improve and enhance the Services, provide support, and for other development purposes including industry-wide benchmarking; provided, however, Subscriber Data used for benchmarking will be aggregated and anonymized, and STREAMOS will not disclose any personally identifiable information provided by You. B. Data Protection Measures STREAMOS will implement, maintain and enforce safety and physical security procedures with respect to its access to and maintenance of Subscriber Data that include reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to help secure the Subscriber Data against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure and will otherwise comply with its Privacy Policy and all applicable law to the extent applicable to any Subscriber Data. STREAMOS will on an annual basis perform testing of its systems as reasonably appropriate to detect potential areas where security could be breached. You agree that these measures are STREAMOS\u2019s only responsibility with respect to the security and handling of Subscriber Data and are in lieu of the terms of Section 10. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, STREAMOS does not and will not accept any obligations in any separate license or other agreement that may apply to the Subscriber Data or use of the Services. In the event of any unauthorized access to Subscriber Data (an \u201cIncident\u201d), STREAMOS will: (i) notify You without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours of discovery; (ii) promptly investigate such Incident and provide a written report of such investigation (including the causes of the breach) to Client; (iii) promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate the effects of such Incident; and (iv) provide You with reasonable cooperation respect to any investigation regarding such Incident C. Data Law Compliance. Each party is responsible for complying with all local, state, provincial, federal, and international laws and regulations applicable to such party\u2019s activities under this Agreement (\u201cApplicable Laws\u201d), including applicable data protection legal requirements, for the purposes of this Agreement. STREAMOS shall implement processes and maintain procedures designed to comply with applicable data protection laws and shall use reasonable efforts to facilitate your compliance with your obligations for data security and response to individual data subject requests with respect to Personal Data (as defined in the Privacy Policy) in STREAMOS\u2019s possession or control, to the extent that you are required to comply with the following: (i) the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Act (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d); (ii) the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and any applicable laws enacted by an EU member state implementing the requirements of GDPR; (iii) the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and National Privacy Principles; (iv) the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act; (v) the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1798.100 et seq. and implementing regulations (\u201cCCPA\u201d); (vi) any other existing or newly enacted Applicable Laws regarding privacy; and (vii) any amendments and successors to the foregoing. This Agreement and the Documentation constitute your instructions to STREAMOS for processing Subscriber Data, and MAXIO shall not process Subscriber Data for any other purpose. STREAMOS may use subcontractors to facilitate its obligations under this Agreement, and STREAMOS shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of such subcontractors relating to this Agreement as though they were those of STREAMOS. STREAMOS shall use commercially reasonable measures to ensure that such subcontractors implement and comply with its security measures in handling any Subscriber Data. If You are a Subscriber and STREAMOS processes Subscriber Data on Your behalf for the provision of the Services, the parties acknowledge and agree that STREAMOS is a \u201cService Provider\u201d as defined in the CCPA, and Subscriber Data may include personal information, as that term is defined by the CCPA (\u201cCCPA Personal Information\u201d). STREAMOS does not sell CCPA Personal Information. When STREAMOS processes CCPA Personal Information for or on a Subscriber\u2019s behalf, STREAMOS collects, retains, uses, and discloses such CCPA Personal Information solely for the permitted purposes described in this Agreement, and for no other commercial purpose. STREAMOS certifies that it understands and will comply with the restrictions set forth in the foregoing paragraph. To the extent that STREAMOS processes any Personal Data on Your behalf, you agree that STREAMOS does so as a processor only, and you and STREAMOS further agree that (i) the terms and conditions of the Data Processing Addendum (the \u201cDPA\u201d) are incorporated herein; (ii) you and we will comply with the DPA; and (iii) in the event of any conflict between the terms of the DPA and these Terms or the Privacy Policy, the terms of the DPA will control. D. Limitations. You acknowledge and agree that the Services are not intended for use in the storage, processing, or handling of data that is (i) Protected Health Information subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), (ii) Sensitive Personal Data or (iii) the following data elements (a) Social Security number; (b) driver\u2019s license number or government-issued identification card number; or (c) other than the StreamOS Payments Services, with respect to which Supplemental Terms apply, financial account number, or credit or debit card number, with or without any required security code, access code, personal identification number or password, that would permit access to an individual\u2019s financial account. \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d has the meaning set forth in HIPAA, and \u201cSensitive Personal Data\u201d has the meaning set forth in Article 9 of the GDPR or other applicable data protection legislation. You will not transmit or otherwise include any such information in the Subscriber Data. 8. FEES; PAYMENT TERMS. For Direct Subscribers, the fees payable for the Services (the \u201cFees\u201d) shall be stated and paid in the currency specified in the applicable Order and are non-refundable. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, Direct Subscribers shall pay the Fees within thirty (30) days from the invoice date, without setoff or deductions and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the applicable Order. If any invoiced amount is not received by STREAMOS by the due date, then those amounts shall accrue late interest at a rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, commencing on the date that payment was due. Time is of the essence with respect to all payment obligations of a Direct Subscriber. All Fees are exclusive of federal, state, local and foreign taxes, duties, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (\u201cTaxes\u201d) and Direct Subscribers are responsible for the payment of all Taxes, excluding Taxes on STREAMOS\u2019s net income. STREAMOS reserves the right to modify the Fees for the Services, effective upon commencement of the next Renewal Term, by notifying You of such change in writing at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then-current Term. If You are a Reseller Subscriber, You are responsible for paying all fees and other amounts due to your Direct Subscriber with respect to Your subscription to the Services. You acknowledge and agree that STREAMOS has the right to suspend and terminate your and your End Users\u2019 access to the Services and this Agreement in this event that STREAMOS does not receive, in a timely fashion, all Fees due from your Direct Subscriber with respect to your access to the Services. 9. TERM AND TERMINATION For Direct Subscribers, the term of this Agreement and Your subscription to the Services shall begin on the effective date of the applicable Order and shall continue as stated in such Order. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Order, either STREAMOS or the Direct Subscriber may, at its option, terminate this Agreement if the other party materially breaches the terms of this Agreement or the applicable Order and fails to cure the same within thirty (30) days after notice. For Reseller Subscribers and End Users, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the date you are granted access to the Services and shall end on the date such access is revoked or terminated. Expiration or termination of any Order with a Direct Subscriber shall terminate access and this Agreement for all Reseller Subscribers and End Users accessing the Services pursuant to such Order. STREAMOS may suspend your access to the Services and Subscriber Data during any period that you (or any Subscriber through which you have been granted access) are in material breach of this Agreement or your access to and use of the Services or Subscriber Data creates a material security vulnerability. Where practicable, STREAMOS will give the applicable Subscriber at least two (2) days\u2019 advance notice of the suspension unless the suspension is made under emergency circumstances. STREAMOS will reinstate your access to the Services when the grounds for suspension are cured. Upon termination of Your access to or use of the Services for any reason, STREAMOS will retain Subscriber Data for up to sixty (60) days from the effective date of termination; provided, however, that STREAMOS reserves the right to retain Subscriber Data beyond such period for legal, archival or recordkeeping requirements. If a Direct Subscriber wishes to export Subscriber Data following a termination for breach then, subject to payment of all Fees applicable to such Subscriber\u2019s Account, STREAMOS will either, at its option, enable short-term access to the Services at a scheduled time so that the Subscriber may export Subscriber Data, or export Subscriber Data using its standard export tools; if you are a Reseller Subscriber, you must contact your Direct Subscriber to request that they export your Subscriber Data on your behalf. STREAMOS has no obligation to retain Subscriber Data after the sixty (60) day period and may destroy Subscriber Data any time thereafter. The following sections survive expiration or termination of this Agreement: Section 3 (Intellectual Property Rights), the last paragraphs of Sections 4 and 6, the first paragraph of Section 7 (Subscriber Data); Section 8 (Fee; Payment Terms); Section 9 (Termination); Section 10 (Confidentiality); Section 11 (Indemnification); Section 12 (Limitation of Liability); Section 16 (Governing Law; Export Compliance); and any other terms that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination. 10. CONFIDENTIALITY You and STREAMOS may disclose information to one another, and You may access information in connection with the Services, that is considered by the disclosing party to be proprietary or confidential information (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Confidential Information includes any information or data, in any form, including, but not limited to oral, written, graphic or electronic forms, models, or samples, which the disclosing party identifies as confidential or which is of such a nature that the receiving party should reasonably understand that the disclosing party desires to protect such information or data against unrestricted disclosure or use, including business information, financial data, and marketing data. Subscriber Data is not considered Confidential Information for purposes of this Section 10 and is subject to the terms of Section 7 of these Terms. All Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of the disclosing party, and its confidentiality shall be maintained and protected by the receiving party with the highest degree of care during the term of this Agreement and for a period of three years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement. The receiving party shall not use the Confidential Information of the other party except as necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, nor shall it disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party; provided, however, the receiving party may disclose the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information to its employees, consultants, and agents who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less protective than those set forth in these Terms, and receiving party shall be responsible for any unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information by such persons as if receiving party had made such unauthorized disclosure itself. The restrictions on the use or disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to any Confidential Information: (i) after it has become generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement by the receiving party; (ii) is rightfully in the receiving party\u2019s unrestricted possession prior to disclosure to it by the disclosing party; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party; (iv) is rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; or (v) is disclosed under operation of law (but solely for the purposes of and extent of such disclosure). Further, in the event such disclosure is required of either party under judicial order or requirement of law, such party will, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify the disclosing party of such order or requirement. You understand that STREAMOS implementation and support personnel may need to access Your Account to assist in implementation of the Services, as well as to address support requests that may occur from time to time, but such access shall be on a need-to-know basis. You permit STREAMOS\u2019s implementation and support personnel to access Your Account with the understanding that all information in Your Account (other than Subscriber Data) shall be considered Confidential Information by STREAMOS personnel. 11. INDEMNIFICATION STREAMOS will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Direct Subscriber from and against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities, fees, fines, costs, and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements paid or payable to a third party (collectively, \u201cLosses\u201d) incurred by such Direct Subscriber arising out of any third-party claim that the Services delivered under this Agreement (exclusive of any Subscriber Data) infringe any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of a third party. If the Services or any part thereof becomes the subject of a valid claim of infringement under any patent, copyright or trade secret law, STREAMOS will either procure the right, at STREAMOS\u2019s sole expense, to permit continued use of the Services for such Direct Subscribers (and their associated Reseller Subscribers and End Users), or replace or modify the Services so as to avoid infringement without materially altering the functionality and performance thereof. If STREAMOS reasonably and in good faith determines that neither of the foregoing are commercially practicable, STREAMOS may terminate this Agreement and the licenses granted herein effective immediately upon written notice to its Direct Subscriber and refund the unearned pro-rata portion of any prepaid Fees (if any). THIS PARAGRAPH STATES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND STREAMOS\u2019S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS EXTEND TO DIRECT SUBSCRIBERS ONLY, AND RESELLER SUBSCRIBERS AND END USERS SHALL HAVE NO RIGHTS THEREUNDER. If You are a Subscriber, You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless STREAMOS and STREAMOS\u2019s officers, directors, employees and agents (each, a \u201cSTREAMOS Indemnitee\u201d) against any and all Losses incurred by a STREAMOS Indemnitee in any claim, demand or action brought by a third party (including any regulatory authority) arising out of or relating to (i) Your breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in the Agreement; (ii) Your or your Reseller Subscribers\u2019 or End Users\u2019 use or misuse of the Services; or (iii) Your negligence or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification obligations are contingent upon satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) the indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the third party claim or action (but failure of the indemnified party to so promptly notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent it has been prejudiced thereby); (ii) the indemnified party will reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of the matter, at the indemnifying party\u2019s request and expense; and (iii) the indemnifying party will have sole control of the defense of the action and negotiations for its settlement and compromise, but shall not settle or compromise any underlying claim without the indemnified party\u2019s prior written consent unless such settlement does not (a) admit liability on behalf of the indemnified party; and (b) require the indemnified party to take, or refrain from taking, any action other than the payment of Losses. The indemnified party may, at its own cost, obtain separate counsel to represent its interests. 12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IF YOU ARE A DIRECT SUBSCRIBER, THEN TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND EXCEPT FOR (i) LIABILITY ARISING FROM A MATERIAL BREACH OF SECTIONS 1, 2 OR 10 OF THESE TERMS, (ii) EACH PARTY\u2019S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 11, (iii) LIABILITY ARISING FROM A PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (iv) YOUR OBLIGATION TO REMIT ALL AMOUNTS PROPERLY DUE AND OWING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, BREACH OF WARRANTY AND NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS) SHALL: a. BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES, NOT TO EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID OR PAYABLE (WHICHEVER IS GREATER) BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MONTH IN WHICH THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM BY A DIRECT SUBSCRIBER FOR BREACH OF STREAMOS\u2019S OBLIGATIONS UNDER 7.B (DATA PROTECTION) AS A RESULT OF THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF STREAMOS OR ITS EMPLOYEES, STREAMOS\u2019S LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS; b. NOT INCLUDE (AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS) ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DAMAGES FOR ANTICIPATED PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, ECONOMIC LOSS, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE OF EQUIPMENT, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND c. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY, THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS, OR ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS OR AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DEMANDS OF THIRD PARTIES. IF YOU ARE A RESELLER SUBSCRIBER OR AN END USER, THEN TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, THEN STREAMOS SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THIS AGREEMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THE FOREGOING EXCLUSION IS FINALLY DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE UNENFORCABLE, STREAMOS\u2019S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE SUM OF $100.00. 13. FORCE MAJEURE Neither party shall be under any liability to the other for any delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement (other than a Direct Subscriber\u2019s failure to pay any fees due hereunder) to the extent caused by reason of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of that party and without such party\u2019s fault or negligence, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, strikes, lack or failure of transportation facilities, acts of terrorism, fire, acts of government authority. In the event of a force majeure event, the affected party shall give prompt written notice to the other party, stating the period of time the same is expected to continue. If any such failure or delay in performance continues for more than sixty (60) days, either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other. 14. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS You and STREAMOS are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchisee-franchisor relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. 15. NOTICES Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notice to STREAMOS shall be given via a nationally recognized overnight courier or by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, as follows: Stream Financial Technology Corporation Attention: Legal Counsel 145 S Fairfax Ave #200 Los Angeles, CA 90036 Notice to STREAMOS will be effective upon receipt.

The exclusive jurisdiction of any actions arising out of, relating to, or in any way connected with, this Agreement, shall be in the state, superior or federal courts, as applicable, with jurisdiction over Los Angeles County, California, United States of America, and each of you and we submit to such jurisdiction and waive any objection to the same based on forum non convenience.

We may amend or otherwise modify all or a portion of the Privacy Policy from time to time. The revised Privacy Policy will be available on the STREAMOS Website, and we may also provide Your administrative users (as identified in Your Account) with notice of such changes by e-mail. You are responsible for periodically reviewing the Privacy Policy as posted on the Website. Amendments and modifications to the Privacy Policy will be deemed effective once posted online. Your continued use of the Services following any modification constitutes Your acceptance of the modified terms, except to the extent that (i) other notice or consent is required by Applicable Law; or (ii) such change has a material adverse impact on You and You do not agree to the change, in which case You may terminate this Agreement by giving at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to STREAMOS (such termination notice to be sent at the latest 60 days after such change was posted to the Website). You are not entitled to object to, and shall not have the rights set out in this clause, for any change that STREAMOS implements in order to comply with Applicable Law. For such imposed changes shorter notice periods may be applied by STREAMOS as is need to comply with the relevant requirement.
