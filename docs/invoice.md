# Invoice

The invoice object is streamOS representation of an invoice, it represents all aspects of what will actually get translated into your accounting platform and seen by your customers.

Many of the elements here are controlled by [contract](contracts.md) structures and definitions mentioned earlier in the document. 

- **Invoice Date:** Generated by the system when the invoice is generated approved and sent to the accounting platform
- **Due Date:** Calculated based on the defined payment term in the contract 
- **streamOS Customer ID:** The streamOS reference of the customer id 
- **Accounting Customer ID:** The customer id from your accounting platform that references the same customer
Line Item 
    - **Description:** The description that will reflect on your invoice 
    - **Unit Amount:** The unit amount of the charge that will reflect on your invoice
    - **Quantity:** The quantity 
    - **Total Amount:** Unit Amount * Quantity
    - **streamOS Product Id:** The reference to the item being charged (this could be an actual product or a plan like Fixed Fee)
    - **Accounting Product Id:** The accounting reference to the same item - so the line item can be mapped to the appropriate account

The linkage between the streamOS and Accounting ID's are done through [reconciliation](reconciliation.md).
