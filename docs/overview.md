# Overview

The system consists of the following:

- [Customers](customer.md): Contains everything related to your customers that streamOS requires + some that your accounting platform requires.
- [Products](product.md): Deals with products / services that you provide + some information to manage for your accounting system.
- [Contracts](contracts.md): Is the brain of the AR module, stores key contract logic and the magic that makes them work.
- [Usage](usage.md): Deals with quantities of products or services that are sold over time
- [Invoice](invoice.md): streamOS' representation of an actual invoice, this is as close an approximation of what will be translated to your accounting platform and to your customers.
